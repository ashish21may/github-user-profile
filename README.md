  Currently We are handling multiple changes in drop-down via
  Session storage. And it handles most of the cases except two cases.
  To-Do Item: Below 2 cases
  1. When one filter is selected and other is made all from some other value.
  2. When updatedRepos/ currentrepo becomes empty and we make more selections.

  Above two cases have arisen because I have added aditional functionality 
  As I am working with 2 select dropdowns but example only had one functioning drop-down.
